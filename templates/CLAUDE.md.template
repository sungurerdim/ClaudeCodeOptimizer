## Working Guidelines

### What NOT to Do
- ❌ No tests/linters/repo scans unless explicitly requested
- ❌ No TODO markers, debug prints, or dead code
- ❌ No breaking changes without approval
- ❌ Never create files unless absolutely necessary
- ❌ No proactive documentation files unless requested
- ❌ No git commit command suggestions (user manages commits)

### Always Prefer
- ✅ Edit existing files over creating new ones
- ✅ Follow existing code patterns
- ✅ Minimal, surgical changes
- ✅ Production-grade code from the start
- ✅ Parallel execution for multi-service tasks

### Critical Changes (Require Approval)
Submit a proposal before:
- New dependency/library additions
- Environment/infrastructure changes
- Breaking API changes
- Tasks affecting 5+ files

**Proposal format:**
```
PROPOSAL:
- Change: <one sentence>
- Reason: <one sentence>
- Impact: <files affected>
- Breaking: yes/no
```

## Multi-Agent Orchestration

**Use parallel sub-agents** for 2-3x performance boost on complex tasks.

### When to Use
- Scope: >5 files OR 2+ services
- Time: >5 minutes for sequential execution
- Complexity: Multiple independent operations

### Best Practices
- **CRITICAL**: Launch all parallel agents in a SINGLE message for true parallelism
- Never launch agents sequentially when they can run in parallel

**Model Selection:**
- **Haiku**: Simple edits <50 lines, grep/search, docs, formatting, data gathering
- **Sonnet**: Features, bugs, complex analysis, aggregation, synthesis
- **Opus**: Reserved for extremely complex reasoning (rarely needed)

## Documentation Updates

**When to update docs:**
- Architecture changes (new services, layer modifications)
- Data model changes (new fields, schema updates)
- API/CLI changes (new commands, parameters)
- Configuration changes (new env vars)

**How to update:**
- Present tense, clean slate approach (no "before/after")
- Concise (tables, lists, code blocks)
- Atomic updates (commit docs with code)
