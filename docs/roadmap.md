## Project Goals

CCO aims to solve common challenges in AI-assisted development:

### Consistency & Standards
- Enforce industry best practices systematically
- Prevent AI models from reinventing solutions
- Maintain consistent style and approach across sessions

### Efficiency & Productivity
- Eliminate repetitive setup and configuration tasks
- Automate tedious processes (commits, audits, documentation)
- Smart model selection (Haiku for speed, Sonnet for thinking)
- Parallel agent execution for 2-3x performance

### Quality & Reliability
- Evidence-based verification prevents silent failures
- Anti-overengineering principles prevent bloat
- Comprehensive principle coverage (95 principles: 19 universal + 64 project-specific + 12 Claude guidelines)
- Progressive disclosure minimizes token waste

### Team Collaboration
- Zero-pollution architecture works for individuals and teams
- Git-committable configuration (symlinks, not data)
- Consistent setup across team members
- Intelligent git workflow selection

### Common Problems Solved
- ✅ New feature breaks existing features (principles enforce compatibility)
- ✅ Old feature partially removed (evidence-based verification catches this)
- ✅ Two features coexist creating conflicts (anti-overengineering prevents this)
- ✅ New feature implemented but not actively used (commands enforce usage)
- ✅ Documentation lags behind code (CLAUDE.md generation/merging)
- ✅ AI does more work than requested (principles limit scope)
- ✅ Token waste from loading irrelevant context (progressive disclosure)
