# Incremental Improvement Protocol

Transform overwhelming goals into achievable milestones. Prevent paralysis from "too much to fix".

<!-- INSTRUCTIONS: Load when activated -->
## Detailed Instructions

### When This Skill Activates

This skill activates when audit shows LARGE gap:
- `/cco-audit-tests` finds 20+ untested functions
- `/cco-audit-principles` finds 30+ violations
- Any audit shows "this will take days" amount of work

**Trigger:** Gap > threshold (configurable, default: 20 items)

### The Core Principle

**Don't try to fix everything at once. Break into weekly sprints with celebration milestones.**

Why?
- Overwhelming tasks lead to procrastination
- All-or-nothing approach often becomes nothing
- Progress > Perfection

### The Protocol

#### Step 1: PRIORITIZE by Impact

**For test coverage:**
```
Priority 0 (CRITICAL): Functions that handle money, auth, data validation
Priority 1 (HIGH): Business logic, workflows, integrations
Priority 2 (MEDIUM): Utilities, helpers
Priority 3 (LOW): Internal plumbing, getters/setters
```

**For principle violations:**
```
Priority 0 (CRITICAL): Security, privacy, data loss risks
Priority 1 (HIGH): DRY, architecture, type safety
Priority 2 (MEDIUM): Code quality, testing
Priority 3 (LOW): Style, optimization
```

#### Step 2: SET Weekly Milestones

**Formula:**
```
Week 1: P0 → 100% (ship-blocking issues)
Week 2: P1 → 80% (high-value improvements)
Week 3: P2 → 80% (remaining gap)
Week 4: Polish + buffer
```

#### Step 3: TRACK Progress

Save state in `.cco/state/{PROJECT}/incremental-progress.json`:
```json
{
  "goal": "Reach 80% test coverage",
  "current": "64%",
  "target": "80%",
  "weeks": [
    {
      "week": 1,
      "milestone": "Critical paths to 100%",
      "functions": ["process_payment", "validate_auth", "encrypt_data"],
      "status": "completed",
      "coverage_delta": "+8%"
    },
    {
      "week": 2,
      "milestone": "High-value to 80%",
      "functions": ["create_user", "send_email", "..."],
      "status": "in_progress",
      "coverage_delta": "+6%"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Step 4: CELEBRATE Milestones

After each week:
```
"Week 1 Complete!"
"Critical paths at 100%"
"Coverage: 64% → 72% (+8%)"
"Ship-blocking issues resolved"
"Ready for Week 2?"
```

## Examples & Resources

### Example 1: Test Coverage Gap

**Scenario:**
```
User runs: /cco-audit-tests
Output: "36 untested functions, 64% coverage (goal: 80%)"
```

**Without skill (overwhelming):**
```
User: "I need to write 36 tests?! That's days of work..."
<Procrastinates>
<Never starts>
```

**With skill (achievable):**
```
Skill activates:
"36 untested functions detected. That's a lot! Let's break it down."

Analyzing function criticality...

=== Incremental Improvement Plan ===

```

### Integration with Commands

#### audit-tests.md
Add after reporting, if gap > 20 functions:

```markdown
## Phase 5: Incremental Improvement Planning (if large gap)

If 20+ untested functions, activate incremental-improvement:

Use Skill tool:
Skill("incremental-improvement")

The skill will:
1. Prioritize functions by criticality
2. Create weekly milestones
3. Track progress
4. Celebrate achievements
```

#### audit-principles.md
Add after reporting, if violations > 30:

```markdown
## Phase 5: Incremental Fix Planning (if many violations)

If 30+ violations, activate incremental-improvement:

Use Skill tool:
Skill("incremental-improvement")

Break fixes into manageable weekly sprints.
```

### State Management

Track progress in `.cco/state/{PROJECT}/incremental-progress.json`:

```json
{
  "goal_type": "test_coverage",
  "goal_target": 80,
  "baseline": 64,
  "current": 76,
  "start_date": "2025-01-08",
  "weeks": [
    {
      "week_number": 1,
      "milestone": "Critical Paths",
      "target_coverage": 72,
      "actual_coverage": 72,
      "status": "completed",
      "completion_date": "2025-01-12",
      "functions_tested": [
        "process_payment",
        "validate_auth_token",
        "sanitize_user_input",
        "encrypt_sensitive_data",
        "execute_database_query"
      ]
    },
    {
      "week_number": 2,
      "milestone": "High-Value Functions",
      "target_coverage": 78,
      "actual_coverage": 76,
      "status": "in_progress",
      "functions_tested": [
        "create_user",
        "send_email",
        "generate_report",
        "sync_api"
      ],
      "functions_pending": [
        "batch_process",
        "validate_schema",
        "transform_data"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "total_items": 36,
  "completed_items": 13,
  "completion_percentage": 36
}
```

**Resume command:**
```bash
/cco-continue-improvement
```

### Anti-Patterns to Prevent

#### WRONG: All-or-Nothing

```
User: "36 functions to test. I'll do it all this weekend."
<Works Saturday and Sunday>
<Gets 20/36 done, exhausted>
<Gives up>
Result: 20 tests but no systematic approach
```

#### RIGHT: Incremental Progress

```
Skill: "36 functions. Let's do 5 critical ones this week."
User: <Works 3 hours, finishes 5>
Skill: "Week 1 done! Coverage +8%! Ship-blockers resolved!"
User: <Feels accomplished>
Week 2: <Does 12 more>
Week 3: <Does remaining 16>
Result: All 36 tested with sustainable pace
```

### Success Metrics

**Before (without skill):**
- Completion rate: 30% (give up when overwhelmed)
- Time to complete: Never (or 6 months)
- Team morale: Low (failure feels bad)

**After (with skill):**
- Completion rate: 85% (milestones achievable)
- Time to complete: 3-4 weeks (systematic)
- Team morale: High (celebrate every week)

### When to Skip This Skill

Skip incremental planning if:
- Gap is small (<20 items)
- User has time to fix all at once
- User explicitly requests: `/cco-audit-tests --no-incremental`
