# P051: Async I/O (Non-Blocking Operations) 🔴

**Severity**: High

Use async/await for I/O-bound operations, no blocking calls.

**Why**: Improves responsiveness through non-blocking async operations for I/O tasks

**Enforcement**: Skills required - verification_protocol, test_first, root_cause_analysis

**Project Types**: api, web
**Languages**: python, javascript, typescript

**❌ Bad**:
```
response = requests.get(url)  # Blocks!
```

**✅ Good**:
```
response = await http_client.get(url)  # Async
```
