# P073: Atomic Commits 🟡

**Severity**: Medium

Each commit must contain changes related to a single logical change or category. Never mix unrelated changes in one commit.

**Why**: Atomic commits make git bisect, revert, and code review easier and more effective

**Enforcement**: SHOULD - Strong recommendation

**Project Types**: all
**Languages**: all

**Rules**:
- **Single Logical Change**: One commit = One logical change (feature, fix, refactor, etc.)
- **Group Related Files**: Group related files by category/purpose
- **Separate Unrelated**: Separate unrelated changes into multiple commits

**❌ Bad**:
```
git commit -m "fix login bug, add tests, update README, refactor database"
# Modified: auth.py, tests/, README.md, db.py (4 unrelated changes)
# Mix refactor with new feature
git commit -m "refactor db and add caching"
```

**✅ Good**:
```
# Commit 1: Bug fix only
git commit -m "fix(auth): handle expired tokens in login"
# Modified: auth.py
# Commit 2: Tests only
git commit -m "test(auth): add tests for token expiration"
# Modified: tests/test_auth.py
# Single commit for tightly coupled changes
git commit -m "fix(auth): handle null user in session middleware"
# Modified: auth.py, middleware.py, tests/test_auth.py
# (All changes address the same logical issue)
```
