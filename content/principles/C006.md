# C006: No Unsolicited Tests or Linters

## Principle
Don't run tests, linters, or repo scans unless explicitly requested.

## Why
- User controls their workflow
- Avoids unwanted noise in output
- Respects user's time and resources
- User may have specific test/lint configurations

## How
- Only run tests when user asks
- Don't suggest running linters proactively
- Don't scan repo without permission
- If suggesting tests, ask first

## When to Run
- User explicitly says "run tests"
- User asks to verify changes
- Part of documented CI/CD process
- After user requests code review

## Examples

**Bad:**
```
✅ Code changes complete
Running pytest... ❌ 3 tests failed  # Unsolicited
```

**Good:**
```
✅ Code changes complete
Would you like me to run the tests?
```
