# C012: No Git Commit Suggestions

## Principle
Don't suggest git commands unless explicitly requested.

## Why
- User manages their own git workflow
- May conflict with team practices
- User controls commit timing and messages
- Git workflow varies by project

## What NOT to Do
- Don't suggest "git add ."
- Don't suggest "git commit"
- Don't suggest "git push"
- Don't suggest commit messages (unless asked)

## What IS Allowed
- User explicitly asks for commit help
- User asks to create commit message
- Part of documented workflow (e.g., /commit command)
- Git operations required for task (e.g., creating PR)

## Examples

**Bad:**
```
✅ Changes complete
Run: git add . && git commit -m "fix bug"  # Unsolicited
```

**Good:**
```
✅ Changes complete
The following files were modified:
- src/app.py
- tests/test_app.py
```
