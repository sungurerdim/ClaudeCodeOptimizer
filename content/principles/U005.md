# U005: Minimal Touch Policy

Edit only required files. No "drive-by improvements", no scope creep.

**Rules**:
- Edit only files needed for the task
- Preserve existing conventions
- No unnecessary reformatting
- Production-grade from the start

**Why**: Reduces merge conflicts, makes changes reviewable, prevents scope creep.

**Example**:
```
Task: Fix login bug in auth.py
✅ Edit: auth.py only
❌ Edit: auth.py + reformat utils.py + update README
```
