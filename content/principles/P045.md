# P045: CI Gates 🔴

**Severity**: High

All PRs must pass CI (lint, test, coverage) before merge.

**Why**: Balances test coverage through unit, integration, and E2E testing pyramid

**Enforcement**: Skills required - verification_protocol, root_cause_analysis

**Project Types**: all
**Languages**: all

**❌ Bad**:
```
# No CI, manual testing
```

**✅ Good**:
```
# GitHub Actions: lint -> test -> coverage check
```
