# P067: Evidence-Based Verification 🔴

**Severity**: Critical

Never claim completion without command execution proof. All verification requires fresh command output with exit codes

**Why**: Ensures all claims are backed by objective evidence, preventing false confidence

**Enforcement**: Skills required - verification_protocol, test_first

**Project Types**: all
**Languages**: all

**Rules**:
- **Command Output Required**: Completion claims must include command output
- **No Uncertainty**: Avoid uncertainty language

**❌ Bad**:
```
"Tests should pass now"
"Build looks correct"
"Appears to be working"
```

**✅ Good**:
```
[Runs: pytest]
[Output: 34/34 passed]
[Exit code: 0]
"All tests pass"

[Runs: npm run build]
[Output: Build successful in 2.3s]
[Exit code: 0]
"Build succeeds"
```
