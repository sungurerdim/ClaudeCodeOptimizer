# U002: Fail-Fast Error Handling

Errors must cause immediate, visible failure. No silent fallbacks, no swallowed exceptions.

**Example**:
```python
# ✅ Good
try:
    result = risky()
except SpecificError as e:
    logger.error(f'Failed: {e}')
    raise

# ❌ Bad
try:
    result = risky()
except:
    pass
```

**Why**: Catches bugs early in development before they reach production.

**Rules**:
- No bare except clauses
- No empty catch blocks
- Always log and re-raise
