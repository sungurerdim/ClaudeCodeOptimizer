# U010: Concise Commit Messages

Commit messages must be compact: max 10 lines total, max 5 bullets in body.

**Format**:
```
type(scope): concise description (max 72 chars)

- Key change 1 with brief context
- Key change 2
- Key change 3

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

**Rules**:
- Max 10 lines total (subject + body + footer)
- Max 5 bullets (most important changes only)
- One line per bullet
- No section headers
- Include Co-Authored-By footer

**Example**:
```
✅ Good:
refactor(ci): consolidate tools (P071)

- Replace Black/Bandit/mypy with Ruff (format+lint+security)
- Remove tool configs from pyproject.toml
- Simplify workflow to 3 jobs, 5 steps total

**Why**: Concise commits are faster to read, easier to scan in history.
