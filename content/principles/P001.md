# P001: Fail-Fast Error Handling 🔴

**Severity**: Critical

Errors must cause immediate, visible failure. No silent fallbacks, no swallowed exceptions.

**Why**: Catches bugs early in development before they reach production

**Enforcement**: Skills required - verification_protocol, test_first, root_cause_analysis

**Project Types**: all
**Languages**: all

**Rules**:
- **No Bare Except**: No bare except: clauses
- **No Silent Catch**: No empty catch blocks

**❌ Bad**:
```
try:
    result = risky()
except:
    pass
```

**✅ Good**:
```
try:
    result = risky()
except SpecificError as e:
    logger.error(f'Failed: {e}')
    raise
```
