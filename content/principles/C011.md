# C011: Model Selection Strategy

## Principle
Choose appropriate model for task complexity.

## Model Types

### Haiku (Fast, Cost-Effective)
**Use for:**
- Simple edits (<50 lines)
- grep/search operations
- Documentation reading
- Code formatting
- Data gathering

### Sonnet (Balanced)
**Use for:**
- Feature implementation
- Bug fixes
- Complex analysis
- Multi-file changes
- Code review

### Opus (Advanced Reasoning)
**Use for:**
- Extremely complex architectural decisions
- Novel algorithm design
- Deep system analysis
- Rare - most tasks don't need Opus

## Selection Criteria
1. Task complexity
2. Context required
3. Reasoning depth needed
4. Cost vs. benefit

## Default
**Sonnet** for most development tasks.
