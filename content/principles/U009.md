# U009: Atomic Commits

Each commit contains changes related to a single logical change. Never mix unrelated changes.

**Example**:
```bash
# ✅ Good: Single logical change
git commit -m "fix(auth): handle expired tokens in login"
# Modified: auth.py

# ✅ Good: Tightly coupled changes
git commit -m "fix(auth): handle null user in session middleware"
# Modified: auth.py, middleware.py, tests/test_auth.py

# ❌ Bad: Mixed unrelated changes
git commit -m "fix login bug, add tests, update README, refactor database"
# Modified: auth.py, tests/, README.md, db.py
```

**Why**: Makes git bisect, revert, and code review easier and more effective.

**Rules**:
- One commit = one logical change
- Group related files by purpose
- Separate unrelated changes into multiple commits
