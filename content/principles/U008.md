# U008: Complete Action Reporting

Every action must be explicitly reported to the user. No hidden operations.

**Rules**:
1. Report EVERY tool use that modifies state
2. File operations (Write, Edit, Bash rm/mv/cp)
3. Git operations (commit, push, branch, etc.)
4. Installation/configuration changes

**Action Summary Pattern**:
```
## ✅ Completed Actions

1. **Updated README.md**:
   - Added installation instructions

2. **Deleted files**:
   - temp.txt (cleanup)
```

**Hidden Actions are FORBIDDEN**:
```
❌ FORBIDDEN: Bash("rm file") without mentioning in response
✅ REQUIRED: "Deleted X because Y"
```

**Why**: Builds trust, prevents surprises, enables user oversight.

**Note**: Verification commands (Read, Grep, Git status) don't need reporting.
