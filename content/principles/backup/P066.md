# P066: Agent Orchestration Patterns 🔴

**Severity**: High

Optimize AI agent execution through parallel processing, appropriate model selection, and cost-effective workflows

**Why**: Maximizes performance and minimizes cost through intelligent agent orchestration

**Enforcement**: Skills required - verification_protocol

**Project Types**: all
**Languages**: all

**Rules**:
- **Parallel Agents**: Launch parallel agents in single message
- **Model Selection**: Use appropriate model for task complexity
- **Cost Optimization**: Optimize for cost and performance

**❌ Bad**:
```
# Sequential agent launches (slow)
agent1 = Task("search files")
# Wait for agent1...
agent2 = Task("analyze data")

# Wrong model selection
Task("simple grep", model="opus")  # Expensive!
```

**✅ Good**:
```
# Parallel agents in SINGLE message
Task("search files", model="haiku")
Task("analyze data", model="haiku")
# Both run simultaneously

# Appropriate model selection
Task("simple grep", model="haiku")
Task("complex analysis", model="sonnet")
```
