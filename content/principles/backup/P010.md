# P010: Performance Profiling Before Optimization 🟢

**Severity**: Low

Always profile before optimizing - no premature optimization.

**Why**: Improves code clarity by writing functions that return values instead of modifying state

**Project Types**: all
**Languages**: all

**❌ Bad**:
```
# Optimize without measuring first
```

**✅ Good**:
```
# Profile: python -m cProfile script.py
# Then optimize hotspots
```
