# P069: Incremental Safety Patterns 🔴

**Severity**: High

Implement safety checkpoints (git stash, backups, tests) before and after changes with automatic rollback on failure

**Why**: Prevents data loss and enables quick recovery through systematic safety checkpoints

**Enforcement**: Skills required - verification_protocol, test_first

**Project Types**: all
**Languages**: all

**Rules**:
- **Backup Before Changes**: Git stash before risky changes
- **Test After Change**: Test after every change
- **Automatic Rollback**: Automatic rollback on failure

**❌ Bad**:
```
# Make breaking changes directly
refactor_everything()
# No backup, no tests, no rollback
```

**✅ Good**:
```
# Safety-first approach
git stash
git checkout -b refactor-backup

refactor_module()
pytest tests/

if tests_fail:
    git reset --hard
```
