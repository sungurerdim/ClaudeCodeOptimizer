# P032: Configuration as Code 🔴

**Severity**: High

All config versioned, validated, environment-aware, never hardcoded.

**Why**: Makes configuration reproducible by versioning all config files in git

**Enforcement**: Skills required - verification_protocol, root_cause_analysis

**Project Types**: all
**Languages**: all

**Rules**:
- **No Hardcoded Config**: No hardcoded IPs/hosts

**❌ Bad**:
```
DB_HOST = 'localhost'  # Hardcoded!
```

**✅ Good**:
```
class Settings(BaseSettings):
    DB_HOST: str = Field(..., env='DB_HOST')
```
