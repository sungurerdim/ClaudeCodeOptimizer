# P009: Linting & SAST Enforcement 🔴

**Severity**: High

Use linters (ruff/eslint) AND SAST tools (Semgrep/CodeQL/Snyk) with strict rules, enforce in CI.

**Why**: Catches security vulnerabilities and code quality issues before production

**Enforcement**: Skills required - verification_protocol, root_cause_analysis

**Project Types**: all
**Languages**: all

**Rules**:
- **Has Lint Config**: Project has linter configuration
- **Sast Scanning**: Use SAST tools (Semgrep, CodeQL, Snyk Code)
- **Ci Enforcement**: Linting + SAST enforced in CI pipeline
- **Security Rules**: Enable security-focused rules (bandit, eslint-plugin-security)

**❌ Bad**:
```
# No linter config, no SAST
# Code passes without security checks
```

**✅ Good**:
```
# pyproject.toml - Linting with security
[tool.ruff.lint]
select = ['E', 'F', 'W', 'S', 'B']  # Include bandit security rules

# .github/workflows/ci.yml - SAST in CI
- name: Run Semgrep
uses: semgrep/semgrep-action@v1
with:
config: 'p/security-audit'

- name: Run CodeQL
uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2

- name: Run Snyk Code
run: snyk code test
```
