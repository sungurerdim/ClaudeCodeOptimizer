# P036: Graceful Shutdown 🟡

**Severity**: Medium

Handle SIGTERM, finish in-flight requests before exit.

**Why**: Enables quick problem diagnosis through distributed request tracing

**Enforcement**: Skills required - verification_protocol, test_first, root_cause_analysis

**Project Types**: api, microservices
**Languages**: all

**❌ Bad**:
```
# No signal handling, abrupt termination
```

**✅ Good**:
```
signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, graceful_shutdown)
```
