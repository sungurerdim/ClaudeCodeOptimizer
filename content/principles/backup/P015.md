# P015: CQRS Pattern 🟡

**Severity**: Medium

Separate Command (write) and Query (read) models for complex domains.

**Why**: Catches bugs before merge through peer code review and knowledge sharing

**Enforcement**: Skills required - verification_protocol, test_first, root_cause_analysis

**Project Types**: microservices, api
**Languages**: all

**❌ Bad**:
```
# Same model for read and write
```

**✅ Good**:
```
# WriteModel for commands
# ReadModel (denormalized) for queries
```
