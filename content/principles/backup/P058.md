# P058: Zero Trust Architecture 🔴

**Severity**: High

Never trust, always verify - authenticate and authorize every request

**Why**: Eliminates implicit trust by verifying every access request regardless of source

**Enforcement**: Skills required - verification_protocol, test_first, root_cause_analysis

**Project Types**: microservices, api
**Languages**: all

**Rules**:
- **No Implicit Trust**: No trust based on network location
- **Mtls Required**: Use mTLS for service-to-service

**❌ Bad**:
```
if request.from_internal_network:
    allow()  # Implicit trust!
```

**✅ Good**:
```
token = verify_jwt(request.headers['Authorization'])
if has_permission(token, resource):
    allow()
```
