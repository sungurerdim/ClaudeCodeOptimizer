# P039: Integration Tests for Critical Paths 🔴

**Severity**: High

Test service-to-service workflows end-to-end.

**Why**: Validates production health by running smoke tests after every deployment

**Enforcement**: Skills required - verification_protocol, test_first, root_cause_analysis

**Project Types**: api, microservices
**Languages**: all

**❌ Bad**:
```
# Only unit tests, no integration
```

**✅ Good**:
```
def test_job_workflow():
    # POST /jobs -> Queue -> Worker -> Result
```
