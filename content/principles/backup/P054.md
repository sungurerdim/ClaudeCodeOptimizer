# P054: Supply Chain Security 🔴

**Severity**: Critical

Verify software supply chain integrity through SBOM, provenance, and attestations

**Why**: Prevents supply chain attacks by verifying artifact integrity and dependency provenance

**Enforcement**: Skills required - verification_protocol, root_cause_analysis

**Project Types**: all
**Languages**: all

**Rules**:
- **Sbom Generation**: Generate SBOM for all releases
- **Artifact Signing**: Sign artifacts with Sigstore/cosign
- **Dependency Lockfile**: Use dependency lockfiles

**❌ Bad**:
```
# No SBOM, unsigned artifacts, no lockfiles
```

**✅ Good**:
```
# Generate SBOM: cyclonedx-py
# Sign: cosign sign image
# Use: requirements.txt.lock
```
