# P048: Caching Strategy 🟡

**Severity**: Medium

Redis + CDN, appropriate TTL, cache invalidation.

**Why**: Speeds up repeated requests through intelligent caching at multiple system layers

**Enforcement**: Skills required - verification_protocol, test_first, root_cause_analysis

**Project Types**: api, web
**Languages**: all

**❌ Bad**:
```
# No caching, DB hit every time
```

**✅ Good**:
```
@cache(ttl=3600)
def expensive_query():
```
