# C010: Use Parallel Agents for Performance

## Principle
Use parallel sub-agents for 2-3x speedup on complex tasks.

## When to Use
- Tasks affecting >5 files
- Multiple independent services
- Operations taking >5 minutes sequentially
- Multiple independent analyses needed

## How
**Critical:** Launch all agents in SINGLE message for true parallelism.

**Bad (sequential):**
```
Launch agent 1
Wait for completion
Launch agent 2
Wait for completion
```

**Good (parallel):**
```
Single message with:
- Agent 1 task
- Agent 2 task
- Agent 3 task
(All execute simultaneously)
```

## When NOT to Use
- Simple tasks (<3 files)
- Dependent operations (need sequential results)
- Quick operations (<2 minutes)
