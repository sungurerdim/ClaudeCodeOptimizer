# C002: Prefer Editing Over Creating

## Principle
Always edit existing files over creating new ones.

## Why
- Maintains consistency with existing code
- Reduces duplication
- Keeps project structure stable
- Easier to review and understand changes

## How
1. Search for existing implementations first
2. Check if functionality can be added to existing file
3. Only create new file if editing is truly not viable
4. Document why new file is necessary

## Impact
- Reduces codebase growth
- Improves maintainability
- Simplifies navigation
