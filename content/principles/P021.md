# P021: Context Window Management 🟡

**Severity**: Medium

Optimize AI context usage through model selection, targeted reads, and query format standardization

**Why**: Maximizes context efficiency through structured requests and optimized model usage

**Project Types**: all
**Languages**: all

**Rules**:
- **Query Format**: Use query format [file:line] → [action]
- **Model By Complexity**: Select model by task complexity
- **Parallel Ops**: Parallel independent operations

**❌ Bad**:
```
# Vague request
"Fix authentication bugs"

# Reading full files unnecessarily
Read("auth.py")  # 800 lines
Read("api.py")   # 1200 lines

# Sequential dependent ops
result1 = operation1()
result2 = operation2()
```

**✅ Good**:
```
# Specific query format
"auth.py:127-145 → Add JWT refresh token support"

# Targeted reads
Read("auth.py", offset=120, limit=30)

# Parallel independent ops (in single message)
Task("analyze module1", model="haiku")
Task("analyze module2", model="haiku")
```
