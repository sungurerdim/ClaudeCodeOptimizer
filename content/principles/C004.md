# C004: Minimal Touch Policy

## Principle
Make minimal, surgical changes. Only modify what's necessary.

## Why
- Reduces risk of introducing bugs
- Makes changes easier to review
- Simplifies rollback if needed
- Focuses attention on actual changes

## How
- Identify exact scope of change required
- Don't refactor unrelated code
- Don't fix style issues unless specifically asked
- Keep diffs small and focused
- One logical change per commit

## Examples

**Bad (excessive changes):**
```python
# Task: Fix bug in calculate_total
def calculate_total(items):
    # Fixed bug + reformatted + renamed variables + added comments
    total_sum = 0  # Store the sum
    for item_object in items:  # Iterate through items
        total_sum += item_object.price  # Add price to sum
    return total_sum
```

**Good (minimal change):**
```python
# Task: Fix bug in calculate_total
def calculate_total(items):
    total = 0
    for item in items:
        total += item.price  # Fixed: was using item.cost
    return total
```
