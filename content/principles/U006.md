# U006: Model Selection Strategy

Strategic model selection for cost and performance optimization.

**Model Selection**:
- **Haiku**: Data gathering, scanning, simple edits <50 lines, grep/search, docs, formatting
- **Sonnet** (default): Analysis, reasoning, features, bugs, API endpoints, security fixes
- **Opus**: Avoided unless absolutely necessary (extreme complexity only)

**Why**: Optimizes cost and latency without sacrificing quality.

**Rules**:
- Use cheapest model that can complete the task
- Prefer Haiku for data collection
- Use Sonnet for complex reasoning
- Avoid Opus except for extreme cases
