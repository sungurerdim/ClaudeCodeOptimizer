# U001: Evidence-Based Verification

Never claim completion without command execution proof. All verification requires fresh command output with exit codes.

**Example**:
```
✅ [Runs: pytest] [Output: 34/34 passed] [Exit: 0] "All tests pass"
❌ "Tests should pass now"
```

**Why**: Catches silent failures early, ensures all claims are backed by objective evidence.

**Rules**:
- Command output required for all completion claims
- Always show exit codes
- No uncertainty language ("should", "appears to", "looks like")
