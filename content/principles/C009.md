# C009: Critical Changes Require Proposal

## Principle
Submit proposal before making critical changes.

## Why
- Gives user control over major decisions
- Allows discussion of alternatives
- Prevents wasted effort on wrong approach
- Documents decision rationale

## Critical Changes
- New dependency/library additions
- Environment/infrastructure changes
- Breaking API changes
- Tasks affecting 5+ files
- Database migrations
- Security-related changes

## Proposal Format
```
PROPOSAL:
- Change: <one sentence>
- Reason: <one sentence>
- Impact: <files affected>
- Breaking: yes/no
```

## Examples

**Bad:**
```
Added Redis for caching  # No proposal, just did it
```

**Good:**
```
PROPOSAL:
- Change: Add Redis for session caching
- Reason: Current in-memory cache doesn't scale
- Impact: requirements.txt, config.py, session.py (3 files)
- Breaking: no (transparent replacement)

Should I proceed?
```
