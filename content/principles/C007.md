# C007: No Proactive Documentation

## Principle
Don't create documentation files (README, CONTRIBUTING, etc.) unless explicitly requested.

## Why
- User controls documentation strategy
- May conflict with existing docs
- User may have specific format/location preferences
- Prevents unwanted file creation

## How
- Wait for explicit request
- Ask before creating doc files
- Follow existing doc patterns if they exist
- Keep docs minimal and focused

## When Allowed
- User specifically requests documentation
- Part of accepted proposal
- Updating existing docs to match code changes
- Adding docstrings/comments in code (not file creation)

## Examples

**Bad:**
```
Created new feature X
✅ Also created README.md with usage guide  # Unsolicited
```

**Good:**
```
Created new feature X
Would you like me to update the README with usage examples?
```
