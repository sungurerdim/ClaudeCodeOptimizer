# P003: No Backward Compatibility Debt 🔴

**Severity**: High

Clean migration - delete old system entirely, no config flags for old/new.

**Why**: Prevents bugs from state changes by making data unchangeable after creation

**Enforcement**: Skills required - verification_protocol, test_first, root_cause_analysis

**Project Types**: all
**Languages**: all

**Rules**:
- **No Feature Flags Legacy**: No USE_OLD/USE_NEW feature flags

**❌ Bad**:
```
if USE_NEW_API:
    new_func()
else:
    old_func()  # Tech debt!
```

**✅ Good**:
```
new_func()  # Old system deleted
```
