# U011: No Overengineering

Always choose the simplest solution that solves the problem. Avoid premature abstraction, unnecessary patterns, excessive architecture.

**Example**:
```python
# ✅ Good: Simple and direct
def send_email(to: str, subject: str, body: str):
    smtp.send(to, subject, body)

# ❌ Bad: Premature abstraction
class AbstractDataProcessorFactory:
    @abstractmethod
    def create_processor(self): pass

# For just ONE use case!
```

**Why**: Every line of code is a liability. Simpler code is easier to understand, maintain, debug, and change.

**Rules**:
- No premature abstraction (wait for 3+ similar use cases)
- No unused flexibility (remove unused config options)
- Simple solutions first (no Factory/Strategy/Observer for simple cases)
- Write only what is needed now
