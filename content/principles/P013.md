# P013: Singleton Pattern for Expensive Resources 🔴

**Severity**: High

DB connections, ML models, config must be singleton.

**Why**: Reduces system coupling by using events instead of direct function calls

**Enforcement**: Skills required - verification_protocol, test_first, root_cause_analysis

**Project Types**: all
**Languages**: all

**Rules**:
- **No Resource Recreation**: No repeated expensive resource creation

**❌ Bad**:
```
def get_data():
    client = Redis()  # Creates new each time!
```

**✅ Good**:
```
@lru_cache(maxsize=1)
def get_redis():
    return Redis()  # Singleton
```
