# P068: RESTful API Conventions 🟡

**Severity**: Medium

Resource-based URLs, proper HTTP verbs, status codes.

**Why**: Makes APIs intuitive through RESTful conventions and proper HTTP verbs

**Enforcement**: Skills required - verification_protocol, test_first, root_cause_analysis

**Project Types**: api
**Languages**: all

**❌ Bad**:
```
/getUser?id=123  # Not RESTful
```

**✅ Good**:
```
GET /users/123  # RESTful
```
