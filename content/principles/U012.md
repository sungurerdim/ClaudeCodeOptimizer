# U012: Cross-Platform Bash Commands

Use cross-platform compatible bash commands and path handling.

**Best Practices**:
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT: Cross-platform alternatives
git -C "/path/to/dir" status         # Best: Works on all platforms
git -C "D:/GitHub/project" status    # Windows: Forward slash works in git
(cd "/path" && git status)           # OK: Subshell (any platform)

# Path quoting (all platforms)
cd "/path/with spaces/dir"           # Always quote paths with spaces
```

**Why**: Ensures commands work on Windows, macOS, and Linux without modification.

**Rules**:
- Use git -C instead of cd for git commands
- Always use forward slashes in paths
- Quote all paths with spaces
- Use subshells for directory changes
- Test on multiple platforms
