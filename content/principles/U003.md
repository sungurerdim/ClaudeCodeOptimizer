# U003: Test-First Development

Write failing test FIRST, then implement feature, then verify test passes.

**For new features:**
1. Write failing test
2. Run test, verify it fails
3. Implement feature
4. Run test, verify it passes

**For bugs:**
1. Reproduce bug with failing test
2. Verify test fails for the right reason
3. Fix bug
4. Verify test passes

**Why**: Ensures tests actually verify the behavior, prevents false positives.

**Rules**:
- Test before implementation
- Verify test fails first
- Verify test passes after fix
