# U004: Root Cause Analysis

When debugging, always trace to source. Fix at source, not symptom.

**Process**:
1. Where does the bad value originate?
2. What called this with the bad value?
3. Trace up the stack to entry point
4. Fix at source

**Example**:
```
Error: Function crashes with empty string
↓ Trace: ProcessData('') called function
↓ Trace: APIHandler passed empty string
↓ Trace: User input validation missing
✅ Fix: Add validation at API entry point
❌ Wrong: Add null check in ProcessData
```

**Why**: Prevents band-aid fixes that hide deeper issues.

**Rules**:
- Trace backward through call chain
- Find where it enters the system
- Fix at entry point, not deep in stack
