# P072: Concise Commit Messages 🟡

**Severity**: Medium

Commit messages must be compact: max 10 lines total, max 5 bullets in body, no verbosity. Focus on essential changes only.

**Why**: Concise commits are faster to read, easier to scan in history, and reduce noise

**Enforcement**: SHOULD - Strong recommendation

**Project Types**: all
**Languages**: all

**Rules**:
- **Max Total Lines**: Max 10 lines total (subject + body + footer)
- **Max Bullets**: Max 5 bullets in body (most important changes only)
- **One Line Bullets**: One line per bullet (no multi-line explanations)
- **No Section Headers**: No section headers ('Changes:', 'Rationale:', etc.)
- **Co Authored By**: Include Co-Authored-By footer for GitHub attribution

**❌ Bad**:
```
refactor: eliminate tool redundancy

Tool Consolidation (3 tools instead of 5):
- Replace Black + mypy + Bandit with Ruff
- Keep pip-audit (CVE scanning)
...

Dependency Changes (pyproject.toml):
- Remove: black, mypy from dev dependencies
...
[15 more lines]
```

**✅ Good**:
```
refactor(ci): consolidate tools (P071)

- Replace Black/Bandit/mypy with Ruff (format+lint+security)
- Remove tool configs from pyproject.toml
- Simplify workflow to 3 jobs, 5 steps total
